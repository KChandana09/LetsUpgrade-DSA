Once you know start index and end index of array everyone is able to find middle index of array, but there are certain benefits of using beg + (end â€“ beg)/2 over (beg + end)/2, which are described below :

The very first way of finding middle index is

mid = (beg + end)/2

But there is a problem with this approach, what if value of start or end or both is INT_MAX, it will cause integer overflow.

The better way of calculating mid index is :

mid = beg + (end - beg)/2
