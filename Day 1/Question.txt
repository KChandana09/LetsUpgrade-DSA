Time complexity for the following scenarios:

a) for(i=1;i<=n;i++)
       for(j=i;i<=n;j++)
	  printf("Hi");

  Here the number of times the “Hi” will print is n^2 times. 
  Since the outer loop will execute n times and the inner loop will also execute n times.
  Therefore the total time taken is n*n times which is represented as O(n^2).

b) for(i=1;i<=n;i*=3)
      for(j=1;i<=n;j++)
         printf("Hello");

   Here in the outer loop “i” value is getting tribled with each iteration making the “i” to meet condition very quick. 
   To be precise the time taken will be O(log(n)) for the outerloop.
   The inner loop will execute n times. 
   Therefore the time taken is n*log(n) times which is represented as O(nlogn).
